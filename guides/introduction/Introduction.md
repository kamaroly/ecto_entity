# Introduction

The missing Elixir Phoenix package to achieve Ecto > 80% common operations with < 20% effort.

Inspired by Laravel/ Php Eloquent package, Ecto Entity includes injectable functions that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database.
When using Ecto Entity, each database table has a corresponding Schema(Model) that is used to interact with that table.
In addition to retrieving records from the database table, Ecto Entity allows you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.

The goal of this package is to make it deadly simple to interact with Ecto without having to necessary write custom CRUD operations.
